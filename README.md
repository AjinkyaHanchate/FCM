# FCM
google-services.json :
This file contains developer authentication credentials and configuration settings, which is needed to verify while connecting with GoogleApiClient. You have to put it under root directory of the app i.e under ProjectName/app/. Though your service is working fine with your test device as it is detecting your developer account but after releasing your app in public, it will not work without the json file. So donâ€™t delete it. Create your FCM project here and download the google-services.json file.
